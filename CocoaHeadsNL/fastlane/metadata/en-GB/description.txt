This is the CocoaheadsNL app.  CocoaHeads is a monthly meeting of iOS and Mac developers in the Netherlands and part of the international CocoaHeads.org. In case you would like to meet developers or sponsor an event contact us!

How does it work? Every month we organize a meeting at a different venue including food and drinks sponsored by companies. Depending on the size of the location we put together a nice agenda for developers. Like to sponsor us? Our sponsors will be listed for on our website and app including link and logo for a limited time.
